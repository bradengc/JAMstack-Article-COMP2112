# Jamstack Article | COMP2112 | Braden Scott

The session title is called "State of the Jamstack". What I currently know about Jamstack is some of its strengths. Some of these strengths include higher security, and good performance. I was hoping to learn about any new features and tools that have been released. I would also like to learn about how these new tools improve a developers experience.

## What I Learned

The size of Jamstack is one thing I learned about. over 100 million investors consisting of people and organizations are supporting Jamstack. Matt Biilmann, the CEO of netlify talks about the many improvements that Jamstack has brought the development community. Jamstack countinues to grow and improve overtime, more companies will likely want to be a part of it.

Another thing I learned about was how edge handlers work. They work with netlify edge and allow a developer to run custom code while allowing them to personalize it. This service offers faster authentication and personalization. Edge Handlers are said to shorten the distance between the user and authentication. It is clear that edge handlers will speed up many processes.

One more thing I learned about was the ongoing simplicity of Jamstack architecture overtime. The general purpose data is said to be simpler and easier to reason with. The simpler Jamstack gets, the more services it will likely interact with. It is already a part of several different services and will likely keep widening its horrizons. I think that it is easy to forget that simplicity can greatly increase the uses for something.

## Final Thoughts

Jamstack is a highly developed web architecture that has millions of contributors.this helps to make it a well developed way to create fast and secure applications. I have a few questions about where Jamstack expects to be in 3 years. will the architecture get simpler and become more available to different frameworks? Also, will Jamstack provide exclusive tools for different and compatible frameworks?
